So you are using LightsOut and don't want your pawns to turn on all the lights in the somewhat lit room they are just passing through? You've got areas that are covered just enough with torches, braziers or windows? Look no further; that mod is for you.

There are two settings: desired workplace litness (workplace being the pawn's destination cell where they are actually going to do something) and desired trespassing litness (trespassing means the pawn just running through the room with their target being somewhere else). 
If the workplace is not lit enough - the pawn will attempt to turn on the light in the room. If the average litness of the trespassing route is not lit enough - again, the pawn will attempt to turn on the light in the room.
Otherwise, the light will stay off.

It is mainly intended to be used with Owlchemist's Windows (and will support Dubs Skylights too if Windows are present, thanks Owl). Strategic window placement will let your pawns utilize daylight as much as possible - and, aside from visuals, it will save you some TPS by not flicking lights all the time. I highly recommend setting window transparency to 55+ to avoid some possible hiccups while checking if the cell is lit enough by daylight or not.
